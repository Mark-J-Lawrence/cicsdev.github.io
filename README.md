# IBM CICS on GitHub

## What is this?

This is the
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) website for IBM CICS on GitHub, and is
available at https://cicsdev.github.io.

## How do I update it?

The website follows the
[Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) by using
[gatsby-theme-carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon). 
Check out the quick
[getting started](https://gatsby.carbondesignsystem.com/getting-started) guide and
video!

`gatsby-theme-carbon` at itâ€™s core relies on [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) for page
creation in the `src/pages` directory.

## How do I view my changes?

Running `yarn dev` will start the gatsby site for development.

If you have your own
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), run
`yarn build:clean && yarn deploy` to share your updates using GitHub pages.

There are other
[npm scripts](https://gatsby.carbondesignsystem.com/guides/npm-scripts) which may
be helpful.
